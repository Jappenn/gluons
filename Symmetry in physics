In questo lavoro, consideriamo le descrizioni dello spazio di Fock e alcune proprietà interessanti di
vari sistemi di oscillatori bosonici.


Using a work done in particles research:in this work dated, we going to consider one description of space (the Fock space descriptions
of ...) with some interesting properties of various bosonic oscillator systems.
All are based on a single creation-annihilation pair (detectioning of particles sub-nuclear). All are represented in a suitable Fock
space of states "|n) of form (a*)"|0), n = 0,1,2 • • with a ground state |0) such that o|0) = 0 and a number operator N such that N\n) = n|n)".
Our discourse is given on how we pass from the quantum harmonic oscillator with its well-known commutation relations
[a,a'] = 1,to the study of a generalisation of it that we have elsewhere called and with modification. This gives
rise to the Calogero-Vasiliev oscillator [1][2][3] governed by [0,0'] = l+2i/A" , (1) where i/gR , and К = (—)N obeys
K = K\ K2 = 1, аК + К а = 0, а* К + Ка* = 0.
